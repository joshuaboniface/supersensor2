# Repository Unification

For future expandability to make my life a bit easier, I'm deprecating this repo
and moving the SuperSensor 2.x code back to the original https://github.com/joshuaboniface/supersensor
repository in the branch `v2.x`. Sorry for the inconvenience!

Please update your package configuration URLs to the following:
```
packages:
  joshuaboniface.supersensor: github://joshuaboniface/supersensor/supersensor.yaml@v2.x
```

This repository will remain with a package redirect for a while but will no longer be the source of truth
for Issues, etc. Please direct all activity to that other repository instead!
